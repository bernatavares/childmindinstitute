## Merge Base

We're in the middle of the Girder 3 merge window. This means that all new pull
requests need to be opened against the *master* branch since that's where Girder
3 is actively being developed.

If this is a feature that needs to be included in Girder 2, an additional pull
request needs to be opened against the *2.x-maintenance* branch.
